3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. Include any special instructions about how to login and/or use your application.
All of the new functions we were supposed to add this week aren't working yet... I've worked on this for many hours this week with lots of troubleshooting, but I haven't found the solutions to my issues yet. 

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
Updating, inserting, and deleting recipes.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
None of the new things work yet but I think once I get the updating working then that will be the coolest part of this week's assignment.
6. What is a benefit of having a foreign key constraint?
It means you don't have to write as much code and that is always a benefit. Connecting tables in that way creates a link that fills columns when pne table is filled with populated with data.

1 - Some attempt was made
2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
4 - Meets requirements
5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements


8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I did alot of work but my page still doesn't do the actions it was supposed to this week. I think I'm between a 2-3 but I tried hard.
