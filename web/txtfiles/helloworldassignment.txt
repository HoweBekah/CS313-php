1. Copy and paste the URL for your Heroku web application:
https://calm-savannah-95519.herokuapp.com/hello.html

2. Copy and paste the URL for your GitHub source code repository:
https://github.com/HoweBekah/CS313-php

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. Include any special instructions about how to login and/or use your application.
There's not really anything to function yet. The page loads though. No special instructions

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
All are working.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
I learned that my text editor will push to Heroku and GitHub, I just have to choose
 which one it pushes to and then do the same for whichever I didn't choose first.

6. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment: 5
1 - Some attempt was made
2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
4 - Meets requirements
5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements


7. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
Instead of leaving a blank page I added a heading, picture, and some CSS. 
It also took me forever to figure out which command line interface I needed to use,
 so this assignment took me a little longer than anticipated.
