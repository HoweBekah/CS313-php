4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
The only thing not working currently is the "Back to Category" button.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
It was frustrating at first, but once I figured out how to get the info from my DB then I learned alot about how to populate that info into the html using php.

6. Why should you create a separate user account for your application to access the database?
So that the information in the DB can't be manipulated by any other user. 

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment: 4
1 - Some attempt was made
2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
4 - Meets requirements
5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements


8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
The work I did definitely meets the requirements for this assignment. 
I'd venture it's closer to above requirements because the css looks great and the app performs its main function of displaying recipes in a good looking manner.
