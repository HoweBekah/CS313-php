I think everything is working properly so far.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
Last time I used php I had to use xxamp to be able to deploy my code so I really enjoy just running it straight to heroku.
It's so much faster to see what my changes have done.

HTTP get retrieves information from a server and post adds/updates information on a server.

1 - Some attempt was made
2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
4 - Meets requirements
5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements


8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I feel I did more than just meet the requirements for this assignment because I added a little more php elements and dynamic elements.
