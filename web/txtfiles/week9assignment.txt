4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
It all works

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
I thought the for loop I created was a pretty smart way of forgoing a huge switch statement.

6. In your own words, briefly describe the concept of a callback function and why it is useful.
A callback function is basically a function within a function. It's useful because you can call the callback function in as many other function as you want. 

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment: 5
1 - Some attempt was made
2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
4 - Meets requirements
5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements


8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I feel I went above and beyond because of the time I put into the CSS. It looks much better than it did without the css.
