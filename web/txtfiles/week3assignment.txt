4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
Basically all of the things aren't working. I couldn't figure out how to store my variables without having a database. I'm currently trying to figure out the session variable thing that has been talked about on Slack.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
With what I was able to actually do, I'd say the coolest thing was using grid to arrange the items in my shop. I had never used it in 2 spots before so that was cool to see.
6. List one strength and one limitation of using cookies.
Strength- stores a variable is needed.
Limitation- Sometimes the cookie doesn't stay current and holds a past variable.

1 - Some attempt was made

3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
4 - Meets requirements
5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements


8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I really struggled this week with getting the logic figured out on all of my pages but I at least created all pages and have alot of the other elements that are needed. I tried my best.
