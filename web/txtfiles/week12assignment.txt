After completing the assignment, please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Project Title / One sentence description:
Howe Family Cookbook
My fam's cookbook

2. Copy and paste the URL for your web application (if applicable):
https://arcane-coast-74365.herokuapp.com/cookbook.html

3. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
https://github.com/HoweBekah/thebookofcook

4. Describe the functionality that is currently working, along with any special instructions of how to use your web application:
You can call the db and get individual recipe lists for the different categories. The dropdown category list is also pulled from the db

5. Describe the features that are not yet working correctly.
I'm figuring out how to turn the recipe list items into buttons that will call and load the recipe details. I'm close on that, I think. I need to add all the CSS as well.


6. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:3
1 - Some attempt was made
2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
4 - Meets requirements
5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements


7. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
This is a HUGE improvement from the past couple weeks of working on this. The db calls work and print out correctly. 
There's just one db call left I need to get working (recipe details) and then all I'll need for my app to be done is CSS.

8. Please list any questions you have for the instructor regarding this assignment or this week's topic.
